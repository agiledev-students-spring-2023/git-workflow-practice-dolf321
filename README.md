# [Fidelity Slashes The Value Of Its Twitter Stake By Over Half](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/30/fidelity-slashes-the-value-of-its-twitter-stake-by-over-half/)
I found this article particularly interesting because even large tech CEOs like Elon Musk could face catastrophic financial losses. I think the Twitter acquisition story is a milestone in the business world. Elon Musk is over-leveraged and has lost a lot of money so far in this deal. Will he recover and save Twitter by making it the virtual town square as he promised? Or would he simply fail and become another story of how the mighty have fallen? Nonetheless, I am entirely invested in this story and constantly wonder if there is some strange catch to Elon Musk's advocacy for free speech or if he might have had a few too many beers when he decided to offer to buy Twitter significantly more than market value at 42.5 dollars a share.

I think, if anything, this episode illustrates that tech companies aren't all-powerful or invulnerable after all. While they certainly continue to wield outsized influence in our social discourse and habits, they are coming under increasing scrutiny and criticism from the general public. Musk, having been one of those critics, now finds himself on the receiving end of complaints about what Twitter does. Regardless of whether you support Musk's ideas and endeavors with regards to the social media platform, I think it's safe to say Twitter isn't doing too well and probably won't be well for a while. There may be a silver lining to this story, however; we've been able to see quite a bit of how Twitter works internally because of what Musk has done (for better or worse). Perhaps the next Twitter CEO or other aspiring social media platforms can learn from what hasn't worked for Twitter and find a way to better balance user demands with all of the upkeep needed for such companies.
